        <p>Basically, my site went through a glow-up process.
            I started with some basic goals and kept tweaking things to
            make it cooler.
            Every single decision that i had was based on either me liking the ideea of having certain parts
            of the website or just liked how the exercises looked so i just put them in there.
            You are a incredible teacher
            really , even tough i have not come to classes that much (family issues)the pre-recorded lessons were
            amazing.Also hope that orange juciy thingy u were drinking will taste better:).
            I know that the report should be
            longer but really i can not think of something more that i can add, i just did the website in 2 days started
            friday before submission(i know bad ideea)but like i said certain circumstances and thats were i got.
            Hopefully the site does look that bad , i wanted to try diffrent background animations but i knew some stuff
            was not taught by you yet so i restrained myself, and got this boring kinda dhd looking background.
            at the time of when i write this i still have to finish the contact form since it is kinda broken and i do
            not know why and the video Demonstration at the end.
            I really hope that u will like my website , i did it for fun not for the grade , but of course i still hope
            for a good one :).
            Thank you for visiting my website, Andrei.
            P.S. I needed 8 more words so sorry for doing this but i am tired.Ah and last thing i fixed the contact form i did not put it in main XD.
